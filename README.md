# Lenny Face Generator v1
Lenny Face Generator is a mobile application that I build for my final quarter project in 2017. This application was built in C# using Xamarin Studios. This project has received over 5,000 downloads on the Google Play Store and has an average review of 4.4 out of 5. 

This repo is my first version of the application, which had very few features and did not run as well as the current version on the play store.

## Installation
To install the current version of this application, visit the application's google play store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.application.LennyFace&hl=en_US

## Requirements
To run this app, all you need is android version 5.0 and up

## Project status
This project is no longer being maintained but the updated application still works as expected.
